# Terminal
This example demonstrates how to use BetterEventSystem to create a simple terminal.

It is extremely modular, due to the use of the BetterEventSystem. Try deleting a file/class, removing its instantiation in `Program.cs`, and see what happens.

No errors will be thrown! this is because there are no relationships between the classes- all classes are independent and can be deleted without affecting the other ones.

You can also add another event, in a separate class if you'd like and see how it is instantly integrated into the program. 

Event systems ladies and gentlemen!

## Usage
this program is a command line application. once running:

- type `quit` to exit the program
- type `clear` to clear the screen
- type `help` to see a list of commands
- type `settings <setting> <value>` to change settings or `settings query` to see a list of settings and their current values
- type `blackjack` to play blackjack
- type a non-existent command to create it (if createIfNotExist is true, which it is by default and can be changed with the `settings` command)

cool, right? The help command is auto-generated by reading the events in EventSystem.

all of the event listeners are passed a list of strings, which are the arguments passed to the command. they are are the `object` type, so you can send whatever you want, and cast them to whatever you want.
